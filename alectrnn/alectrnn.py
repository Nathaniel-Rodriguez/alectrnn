# probably want to import something like cmaes
# probably want to import some other stuff too like numpy
# not sure if I want main or interaface for main

# possibility
# alectrnn could just be a wrapper for everything else
	# it just is a class with a big list of cmaes settings
	# agent settings
	# objective settings
	# ALE settings
	# graph options

# Actual main would just import alectrnn setup dictionary or something
# and run alectrnn.

# Still have no idea how too..... get this to compile on git with dependencies...
